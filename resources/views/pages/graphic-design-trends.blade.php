Have you ever thought about what design innovations we are going to see which will dominate the landscape in 2022? Let us highlight and summarize the top 8 graphic trends below which will prevail in 2022.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/ghraphic.png" alt="Graphic Design Trends" class="img-fluid">

          <h5 class="mt-2">1.	Inclusive Visuals</h5>
          <p>Exhibiting diversity of human life and inclusive visuals have now become a necessity. It has become the #1 graphic design trend of 2022.</p>
          <p>Venngage’s team, Slack, Trello, HubSpot, Shopify, Search Engine Journal all are implementing inclusive visuals and diversity approaches in their marketing campaigns. They are showing more diverse groups of people in their visuals over the last year.</p>
          <p>The landing pages of Slack have diverse faces greeting the users. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to create visual marketing material which must be appealing and open to wider audiences.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/inclusive.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="inclusive">

          <h5 class="mt-2">2. Fun Data Visualizations</h5>
          <p>Creating simple charts, patterns and graphs that showed a story was the best way to keep audiences engaged and informed but the brands now have taken this approach to an entirely new level. Instead of showing simple charts, brands are using more fun data visuals and it has become a popular graphic design trend of 2022.</p>
          <p>Twitter marketing has been using colorful and engaging charts and graphs for a variety of topics throughout the year. These fun data visualizations easily capture the attention of the users on Twitter. LinkedIn has also used similar approach of showing fun data visualizations to grab the attention of the audience. </p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Visualizations.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Visualizations">
          <p>HubSpot’s Instagram contains a lot of pleasant & fun data visualizations. Their pattern of using colors is remarkable.</p>
          <p>Keeping the design simple and content relevant is the key to win.</p>
          <p>Venngage’s team ran a few data stories on Instagram using this strategy. They used a single-color theme throughout their visuals which helped them to keep their story in focus. Fun data visuals have now become an integral part of marketing now because the users always stop to look a chart or a graph. Therefore, fun data visualization is trending in graphic design in 2022.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-2">3. Bold backgrounds</h5>
          <p>Use of bold backgrounds & bright colors have now become a trend and will prevail in the graphic design trends list for 2022.</p>
          <p>Bold backgrounds and bright colors help visuals stand out in the highly competitive online universe.</p>
          <p>Consider the example of Spotify. Spotify has been consistently using bold backgrounds and bright colors all across its social media channels.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Bold-backgrounds.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Bold backgrounds">
            <p>Bold colors make a perfect combination with lighter text help the images stand out on a social feed. As a result, users immediately click on posts and ads to find out and explore more about the product/service/offering.</p>
            <p><strong>Mailshake</strong> is another good example as they have also incorporated multicolored bold backgrounds on their blog posts.  </p>
            <p>Simplex Outsourcing recommends using a combination of bright colors and bold backgrounds with muted tones because it gives a soothing effect to the eyes.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-2">4. Colorful Icons and Illustrations</h5>
          <p>Pairing bold backgrounds with colorful with equally colorful icons and illustrations is a great way to stand out from the competition.</p>
          <p>Using colorful icons is always a powerful marketing tool because they convey message effectively and are also acknowledged globally.</p>
          <p><strong>Sprout Social</strong> has chosen the colorful way of showing its icons. It has combined colorful icons with bold backgrounds. This contrast is really amazing and engage the eyes immediately. Therefore, Simplex Outsourcing recommends using colorful icons and illustrations with bold backgrounds to convey your message more effectively.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Illustrations.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Illustrations">
          <p>Toolbox HR used colorful illustrations magnificently. It has used a really good mix of interpretative illustrations and simple icons. It is giving a colorful vibe to the whole brand.  </p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Illustrations2.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Colorful Icons and Illustrations">

          <p>At Simplex Outsourcing, we have been continuously using colorful icons and illustrations as per the latest trends because colorful icons and illustrations are really appealing.

          <h5 class="mt-2">5. Serif Fonts</h5>
          <p>Serif Fonts have made a strong comeback and they will continue to stay for 2022 among the top trends. Serif is a classical type of simple but elegant looking font. These not only look stylish and nostalgic but also appeal to the eyes and captures the attention immediately. </p>

          <h5 class="mt-2">6. Branded Memes</h5>
          <p>Its really hard rather impossible to avoid memes because everyone loves memes and everyone loves to watch, like, comment and share memes with their friends, family and social circle. There is a meme for everything and everything can be turned into a meme.</p>
          <p>Some memes go viral within minutes. Memes once become viral can have a shorter or longer lifespan and we can even see its extended versions as well. Memes can disappear out within a day or within few hours but some of them are evergreen and continue to be recognized years later on as well.
          <br>Brands are now more open to memes and branded memes has become a hot trend. 
          </p>
          <p>Consider the example of Shopify. This meme worked for Shopify because of its simplicity. The actors and the context may not be relevant in a few months but the visual is so simple and attractive that it conveys the story the brand is trying to tell. That is why branded memes are most of the times successful. Keep in mind that the visual used in the meme should stand out on its own. The best memes communicate plenty without any context.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Branded-Memes.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Branded Memes">
          <p>We can find inspiration from Foundation Inc. This brand has been consistently choosing the best memes for its social media. It is right to say that they have become a lean mean meme factory over the past year. They made it easy to understand the visual. You don’t need any background. The context is obvious.</p>
          <p><strong>Buffer</strong> is also a good example. <strong>Buffer</strong> has also been getting into the meme game with this grid. We can surely say that every social media manager will recognize these feelings.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Branded-Memes2.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Branded Memes">
          <p>Memes are always fun and engaging. Memes share universal messages which make them an easy visual to adapt to your business needs.
          <br>Simplex Outsourcing would like to inform you that the important thing to remember with this 2022 graphic design trend is avoiding overuse. Memes can become musty very quickly. Don’t rely solely on memes as the only method of visual communication. Always use a variety of visual tools and pepper in memes from time to time.

          <h5 class="mt-2">7. Quotes</h5>
          <p>Graphic design trends are cyclical. Some years back, quotes were highly in and popular. We used to see Inspirational quotes from marketing gurus, business tycoons and experts everywhere but later on people started getting bored and frustrated with the same quotes showing up all the time. Now the trend has changed slowly.</p>
          <p>LinkedIn has shared highlighting a user’s reading initiative. This quote served as social proof but it also showed that LinkedIn is engaging with its community.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Quotes.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Quotes">
          <p>At Simplex Outsourcing, we advise our clients that quotes being shared in the marketing visuals must have more to do with the education rather than inspiration.
          <br>Quotes are a good way to spark conversation.
          <br>LinkedIn has been bold enough to throw it back to the old classics on Twitter, though. Here is a quote from Aristotle for the brand’s #MondayMotivation posts.
          </p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Quotes2.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Quotes">
          <p>At Simplex Outsourcing, we would like to advise you that the use of quotes in visual marketing has evolved. There is certainly a room for quotes in the marketing strategy now but the real hack is to find one soundbite that must stands out and use that for your visual.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-2">8. Social Screencaps</h5>
          <p>Brands are sharing versions of the same post on multiple social media channels for quite a while now but each platform has its unique voice and appeal. It is not always feasible to create separate content all the time. Brands need to share announcements, news, contests or product launches on all social media channels and they want to share it at the same time. The best way to do this is through social media screencaps. They have been gaining popularity not only amongst individuals but also amongst the brands.</p>
          <p>Have a look at <strong>HubSpot’s</strong> Instagram posts, we will often see these types of images appear there. The posts are screenshots of the tweets overlayed on HubSpot’s signature brand visuals.
          <br>This trend is becoming popular and we can’t help but love and adopt it. There is no way to share the posts directly from Twitter to Instagram at the moment as Twitter is a very text-based medium but Instagram is entirely visual but these marketing tips and tricks that <strong>HubSpot</strong> has shared are relevant to their audience. No matter what platform they are on!
          <br><strong>HubSpot</strong> has taken to screenshotting these tweets and sharing them on its Instagram.
          </p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Social-Screencaps.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Social Screencaps">
          <p>We will see the graphic trend of social screencaps taking over in time for 2022.
          <br>Brands aren’t just sharing tweets on Instagram and LinkedIn. Zoom is sharing its Tik-Tok videos on the Instagram.
          </p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Social-Screencaps2.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Social Screencaps">
          <p>Instagram’s new video settings allow a variety of sizes and Tik-Tok’s vertical orientation fits perfectly on Instagram and Zoom is even sharing their Tik-Toks on Twitter as well.</p>
          <img src="media/pages/blog/Social-Screencaps3.png" class="img-fluid m-2" alt="Social Screencaps">
          <p>At Simplex Outsourcing we brief our clients that users on social media are not there for sale-oriented content but they are rather there to be entertained and to learn quick tips and tricks. Therefore, the success ingredient is to bring multiple platforms together through social screencaps.</p>
          <p><strong>The graphic design trends of 2022 are changing the social landscape of the world. Brands are trying their best to put their foot forward in every aspect of their business life. Companies in 2022 will adopt such visuals that will act as a window into their philosophy and mission.
